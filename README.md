# Data summarization with OpenAI

Live app: https://data-summarizer.herokuapp.com/

### What is this?
With all of the progress happening then in generative AI space, I felt compelled to learn more about some the current capabilities by building something simple. After a quick brainstorm and playing around in the OpenAI playground, it seemed like a really compelling capability of GPT3.5 is that it can summarize data/text rather well. 

This made me think back to all of the time that ive spent in the past generating beautiful tables or charts only having to spend just as long writing a nice written summary of what that chart is showing. With that painpoint in mind, I designed a prompt and wired it up with text-davinci-003 model to output nice summaries of data. 

The app is very simple (and not very good looking!) for now, but i plan to enhance the design so that the trends and inputs are more clear. I'd also like to add the ability to create charts out of written data, basically doing the opposite of the current application.
